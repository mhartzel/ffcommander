# Name
ffcommander - An easy frontend to FFmpeg and Imagemagick to automatically process video and manipulate subtitles. FFcommander supports all video formats FFmpeg recognizes including: DVD and Bluray rips (mkv), DVB files, etc.

# Synopsis
ffcommander \[ options ] \[ file names ]  
The output files are places in directory: **00-processed_files**

# Description
I wrote FFcommander out of frustration to Handbrake and its limitations. FFcommander does for me everything Handbrake does and also tries to be clever and choose many settings automatically. FFcommander does the following things by default (these can also be turned off if you prefer to set these parameters yourself):

- Always deinterlace.  
- Calculate optimal video bitrate automatically based on video size.  
- Always use 2-pass video encoding to get the best quality in the smallest possible file size. Constant quality compression is also available but in my opinion nothing beats 2-pass quality for dark scenes.  
- Always copy original audio to the processed video to keep audio quality at its best. You can also recompress audio and let FFcommander automatically calculate bitrate based on the number of channels.  

# What FFcommander can do for you
Imho these things set FFcommander apart from other video processing programs I've used:

- The **-sp** and **-sr** options let you burn subtitles on top of video while resizing and moving subs up or down right to the edge of the screen. This prevents subtitles ever being displayed on top of an actors face. The subs are centered and the positioned automatically at the edge of the screen. The position at the edge is automatically calculated based on video resolution.   

- Cut out parts of a longer video and create a compilation of these (option **-sf**).

- Create an HD and SD - version of a video at the same time (**-psd**).

- Burn timecode on top of video (**-tc**). Autocrop (**-ac**) or change video to grayscale (**-gr**), denoise (**-dn**) or inverse telecine video (**-it**).

- Burn subtitles on top of video while converting them to grayscale (**-sgr**). Mux DVD or Bluray subtitle images into the processed file (**-sm** or **-smn**). This lets you turn subtitles on or off while watching the video.

- Scan source files to display video, audio and subtitle info to find files that you can process all with the same options in one go (**-scan**).

- Display the complex commandlines that FFcommander creates for FFmpeg to learn how FFmpeg works (**-print**).

# Program installation
FFcommander source code does not have any external dependencies so building the program is very easy. You just need to install a couple of programs from your distros repo.  

- Install FFmpeg, Imagemagick, git, and the go - language compiler:  

- Arch or Manjaro: **pacman -S ffmpeg imagemagick go go-tools**  
- Debian or Ubuntu: **apt-get install ffmpeg imagemagick golang**  


- Get the source code: **git clone https://github.com/mhartzel/ffcommander.git/**  
- Go to source directory: **cd ffcommander.git/**  
- Build the program: **go build ffcommander.go**  
- Copy the executable: **ffcommander** to some directory in your path for example: **sudo cp ffcommander /usr/bin/**

# Manpage installation
- Go to source directory: **cd ffcommander.git/manual_page/**  
- Use the command: **manpath** to display directories that the man - command searches for pages, pick one and copy the manpage there. For example: **sudo cp ffcommander.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/**
- Update the manual database: **sudo mandb**

# Video options
**-ac** Autocrop. Find crop values automatically by doing 10 second spot checks in 10 places for the duration of the file.  

**-crf** Use Constant Quality instead of 2-pass encoding. The default value for crf is 18, which produces the same quality as default 2-pass but a bigger file. CRF is much faster that 2-pass encoding.  

**-dn** Denoise. Use HQDN3D - filter to remove noise from the picture. This option is equal to Hanbrakes 'medium' noise reduction settings.

**-gr** Convert video to Grayscale. Use this option if the original source is black and white. This results more bitrate being available for b/w information and better picture quality.

**-it** Perform inverse telecine on 29.97 fps material to return it back to original 24 fps.

**-mbr** Override main videoprocessing automatic bitrate calculation and define bitrate manually.

**-nd** No Deinterlace. By default deinterlace is always used. This option disables it.

**-psd** Parallel SD. Create SD version in parallel to HD processing. This creates an additional version of the video downconverted to SD resolution. The SD file is stored in directory: sd

**-sbr** Override parallel sd videoprocessing automatic bitrate calculation and define bitrate manually. SD - video is stored in directory 'sd'

**-sf** Split out parts of the file. Give colon separated start and stop times for the parts of the file to use, for example: -sf 0,10:00,01:35:12.800,01:52:14 defines that 0 secs - 10 mins of the start of the file will be used and joined to the next part that starts at 01 hours 35 mins 12 seconds and 800 milliseconds and stops at 01 hours 52 mins 14 seconds. Don't use space - characters. A zero or word 'start' can be used to mark the absolute start of the file and word 'end' the end of the file. Both start and stop times must be defined.

**-ssd** Scale to SD. Scale video down to SD resolution. Calculates resolution automatically. Video is stored in directory 'sd'

**-tc** Burn timecode on top of the video. Timecode can be used to look for exact edit points for the file split feature

# Audio options
**-a** Audio language: -a fin or -a eng or -a ita  Find audio stream corresponding the language code. Only use option -an or -a not both.  

**-an** Audio stream number, -an 1. Only use option -an or -a not both.                 

**-ac3** Compress audio as ac3. Bitrate of 128k is used for each audio channel meaning 2 channels is compressed using 256k bitrate. 6 channels uses the ac3 max bitrate of 640k.  

**-aac** Compress audio as aac. Bitrate of 128k is used for each audio channel meaning 2 channels is compressed using 256k bitrate, 6 channels uses 768k bitrate.  

**-opus** Compress audio as opus. Opus support in mp4 container is experimental as of FFmpeg vesion 4.2.1. Bitrate of 128k is used for each audio channel meaning 2 channels is compressed using 256k bitrate, 6 channels uses 768k bitrate.  

**-flac** Compress audio in lossless Flac - format  

**-na** Disable audio processing. The resulting file will have no audio, only video.  

# Options affecting both audio and video
**-ls** Force encoding to use lossless 'utvideo' compression for video and 'flac' compression for audio. This also turns on -fe. This option only affects the main video if used with the -psd option.  

# Subtitle options
**-s** Burn subtitle with this language code on top of video. Example: -s fin or -s eng or -s ita  Only use option -sn or -s not both.  

**-sd** Subtitle `downscale`. When cropping video widthwise, scale down subtitle to fit on top of the cropped video instead of cropping the subtitle. This option results in smaller subtitle font. This option affects only subtitle burned on top of video.  

**-sgr** Subtitle Grayscale. Remove color from subtitle by converting it to grayscale. This option only works with subtitle burned on top of video. This option may also help if you experience jerky video every time subtitle picture changes.  

**-sn** Burn subtitle with this stream number on top of video. Example: -sn 1. Use subtitle number 1 from the source file. Only use option -sn or -s not both.  

**-so** Subtitle `offset`, -so 55 (move subtitle 55 pixels down), -so -55 (move subtitle 55 pixels up). This option affects only subtitle burned on top of video.  

**-sm** Mux subtitles with these language codes into the target file. Example: -sm eng, or -sm eng,fra,fin. This only works with dvd, dvb and bluray bitmap based subtitles. mp4 only supports DVD and DVB subtitles not Bluray. Bluray subtitles can be muxed into an mkv file using the -mkv option.  

**-smn** Mux subtitles with these stream numbers into the target file. Example: -smn 1 or -smn 3,1,7. This only works with dvd, dvb and bluray bitmap based subtitles. mp4 only supports DVD and DVB subtitles not Bluray. Bluray subtitles can be muxed into an mkv file using the -mkv option.  

**-palette** Hack dvd subtitle color palette. Option takes 1-16 comma separated hex numbers ranging from 0 to f. Zero = black, f = white, so only shades between black -> gray -> white can be defined. FFmpeg requires 16 hex numbers, so f's are automatically appended to the end of user given numbers. Each dvd uses color mapping differently so you need to try which numbers control the colors you want to change. Usually the first 4 numbers control the colors. Example: -palette f,0,f  This option affects only subtitle burned on top of video.  

**-sp** Subtile Split. Have you ever been annoyed when a subtitle is displayed on top of a actors face ? With this option you can automatically move subtitles further up and down at the edge of the screen. Distance from the screen edge will be picture height divided by 100 and rounded down to nearest integer. Minimum distance is 5 pixels and max 20 pixels. Subtitles will be automatically centered horizontally. You can also resize subtitles with the -sr option when usind Subtitle Split. The -sr option requires installing ImageMacick. The -sp option affects only subtitles burned on top of video.

**-sr** Subtitle Resize. Values less than 1 makes subtitles smaller, values bigger than 1 makes subtitle larger. This option can only be user with the -sp option. Example: make subtitle 25% smaller: -sr 0.75   make subtitle 50% smaller: -sr 0.50 make subtitle 75% larger: -sr 1.75. This option affects only subtitle burned on top of video.  

# Scan options                                                        
**-f** This is the same as using options -fs and -fe at the same time.  

**-fe** Fast encoding mode. Encode video using 1-pass encoding.  

**-fs** Fast seek mode. When using the -fs option with -st do not decode video before the point we are trying to locate, but instead try to jump directly to it. This search method might or might not be accurate depending on the file format.  

**-scan** Only scan input file and print video and audio stream info.  

**-st** Start time. Start video processing from this timecode. Example -st 30:00 starts processing from 30 minutes from the start of the file.  

**-et** End time. Stop video processing to this timecode. Example -et 01:30:00 stops processing at 1 hour 30 minutes. You can define a time range like this: -st 10:09 -et 01:22:49.500 This results in a video file that starts at 10 minutes 9 seconds and stops at 1 hour 22 minutes, 49 seconds and 500 milliseconds.  

**-d** Duration of video to process. Example -d 01:02 process 1 minutes and 2 seconds of the file. Use either -et or -d option not both.  

# Misc options
**-debug** Turn on debug mode and show info about internal variables and the FFmpeg commandlines used.  

**-mkv** Use matroska (mkv) as the output file wrapper format.  

**-print** Only print FFmpeg commands that would be used for processing, don't process any files.  

**-v ** or **-version** Show the version of this program.  

**-td** Path to directory for temporary files, example_ -td PathToDir. This option directs temporary files created with 2-pass encoding and subtitle processing with the -sp switch to a separate directory. If the temp dir is a ram or a fast ssd disk then it speeds up processing with the -sp switch. Processing files with the -sp switch extracts every frame of the movie as a picture, so you need to have lots of space in the temp directory. For a FullHD movie you need to have 20 GB or more free storage. If you run multiple instances of this program simultaneously each instance processing one FullHD movie then you need 20 GB or more free storage for each movie that is processed at the same time. -sp switch extracts movie subtitle frames with FFmpeg and FFmpeg fails silently if it runs out of storage space. If this happens then some of the last subtitles won't be available when the video is compressed and this results the last available subtitle to be 'stuck' on top of video to the end of the movie.  

**-h** Display help text.

# Examples
### Burn DVD, Bluray or DVB subtitle on top of video
- Display information about video files to find out if they can all be processed in one go: **ffcommander -scan videofiles\*** Sample display below for one file.

>Video width: 720, height: 576, codec: mpeg2video, color subsampling: yuv420p, color space: unknown, fps: 25.000, average fps: 25.000
>Audio stream number: 0, language: eng, for visually impared: 0, number of channels: 2, audio codec: ac3
>Subtitle stream number: 0, language: fin, for hearing impared: 0, codec name: dvd_subtitle

- Check if the same audio and subtitle language exists for all files
- Check the files for black borders in the video. You can use autocrop (**-ac**) to remove these.
- Process files, here we want english audio and english subtitle burnt on top of video: **ffcommander -a eng -s eng videofiles\***

### Burn subtitle on video and reposition and resize it as well
- Play video with for example the mpv player and display subtitles (press j on the keyboad when video is playing). Find a place in the video where there are two row subtitles displayed and make note of the time (for example starts at 5 mins 10 seconds and ends at 5 mins 40 secs).
- Make a test run processing only 30 seconds of the video to find out the best size for the subtitle: **ffcommander -sp -sr 0.7 -st 05:10 -et 05:40 -f videofile**
- The above means: -sp repostition subtitles above the center to the upper edge and subs below center to the lower edge of the screen. -sr resize subtitle (-sr 1 means no change, numbers below 1 make the subs smaller). -st = start time, -et = end time, -f = fast processing (1-Pass compression).
- Play the videofile full screen and check if the subtitle size is satisfactory. Adjust the number after -sr until it is and then process the whole files: **ffcommander -sp -sr 0.65 videofile**

### Mux multiple DVD, DVB or Bluray subtitles in the video file
- You want to select which subtitle language is displayed while playing the video. Example: **ffcommander -sm eng,fra,fin videofile(s)** This muxes english, french and finnish subtiles in the video.
- This only works with dvd, dvb and bluray bitmap based subtitles. Mp4 only supports DVD and DVB subtitles not Bluray. Bluray subtitles can be muxed into an mkv file using the -mkv option.

### Process only one part of a video
- A video is 90 minutes and you want to process only the part between 12 mins 14 secs - 25mins 50 secs: **ffcommander -st 12:14 -et 25:50 videofile**

### Combine multiple parts of a video to a new file
- Play the video for example with mpv and turned on time display (ctrl + o)and take note of the in and out points where you want to cut the video.
- Define cut points on the commandline either using only commas or using commas and slashes: **ffcommander -sf 05:44-05:59,08:17-10:22,14:42.380-17:47.590 videofile**
- The above example combines three parts of the video to one: 5m 44sec - 5min 59sec and 8min 17sec - 10min 22sec and 14min 42sec 380millisec - 17min 47 sec 590 millisec.
- The program displays the timecodes for the cut points in the new video. Please check these and try adjusting cut point times if glitches exists.

### Create HD and SD versions simultaneously
- Take english audio and burn english subtile on top of the audio: **ffcommander -a eng -s eng -psd videofile\***
- The SD - files will be placed in directory 'sd'.

### Inverse Telecine
- When you process or scan a file you get the following warning message:  

>**Warning: Video frame rate is 29.970. You may need to pullup (Inverse Telecine) this video with option -it**  

- This means that the video was probably shot using 24 frames / second and later converted to 29.970 fps to be compatible with NTSC televion refresh rate. The conversion was done duplicating fields every now and then and this process needs to be reversed for the file to play smoothly on modern TV's.
- Use the -it option to remove extra fields and return the video to the original 24 (or 23.976) frame rate: **ffcommander -it videofiles**

### Disable deintelacing and automatic video bitrate calculation and recompress audio to acc
- **ffcommander -nd -mbr 2500 -aac videofiles** This uses 2500kbps for the video bitrate.  
- **ffcommander -nd -crf -aac videofiles** This uses constant quality 18 for the video compression.

## Complex processing example 1
- Use english audio (**-a eng**) and burn english subtitle on top of video (**-s eng**). Reposition subtitles at top and bottom edge of screen (**-sp**) and downsize subtitle to be 50% of the original size (**-sr 0.5**). Use autocrop (**-ac**) to remove black bars from video and create SD - versions of the videos simultaneously with the HD versions (**psd**).
- **ffcommander -a eng -s eng -sp -sr 0.5 -ac -psd videofiles\***

- You can modify and run these commands to learn how FFmpeg commandline options work. Naturally it is easier to start studying FFmpeg with a more simple example than this :)

# Exit Values
Sane exit values are still on my to do list.

# Why this program exists
I grew tired of using Handbrake because of it's limitations and quirks. I've been using FFmpeg in my other projects (FreeLCS) and have become familiar with FFmpeg's immense power. There aren't many things you can't do with it. But the commandline options become very complicated very fast when doing complex things with it.  

FFcommander started as a shell script to automate creating these complex commandlines for FFmpeg. After getting tired of Bash's strange syntax I rewrote the program in Go and added features whenever I needed to do some new type of processing. Now a couple of years later I find that FFcommander is a very capable program and I never need anything else for processing my videos. At this point I think the program is probably useful for other people as well and ready to publish.  

All this means that FFcommander still is my personal project and I might not accept any feature requests for it. Since FFcommander is released under GPL 3 you are welcome to make your own modifications or a fork of it.

# Bugs
There probably are some. There is a plethora on commandline options and I have not been able to test each in combination with each other. FIXME minne ilmoitetaan bugit ?
